Creating a website design is much more fun than anticipated, what I learn about it is thew flexibility to different 
methods to connecting various pages. It also helps me to see and think on what should be omitted and added to the 
design. Like in designing, there is no such thing as one true perfect design, it all comes down to trial and error. 
The more I work with my partner, Cindy, the more I realized that committing notes on the work is very important to 
understand what each objects do while implementing it on the actual software design page to clean out the edges and 
such. The parts that I did was adding the rough ideas that were design on paper to the online software and do changes
on some appearances and requirements from user information. I also took the liberty of adding a bit more features to 
the web design to make it look more simple and user friendly.
